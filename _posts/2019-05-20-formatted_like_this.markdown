After reading the prompt for the project, I initally thought of something meaningful that would make this project more enjoyable and interesting (not that there's anything wrong with building a CLI). Eventually, I chose the best attractions in Banff, Alberta, Canada, which is in the Canadian Rockies. Two years ago, I had gone on a 12-day trip there with my best friend Josh and it was probably the most fun I've ever had on a trip. The scenes and sights were jaw-dropping and truly awesome, and I still think of it frequently, after all this time. 

Needless to say, making a project based on something you care actually applies more pressure, since you want to represent that topic well. Starting with a blank slate is definitely the most daunting aspect of building a project. But once I got the ball rolling after a couple days, it got easier and easier. But, I definitely was a little too easy going for the first couple of days. It took a much longer time to understand how I should be connecting relating the classes and methods together. I need to work harder at all times if I want to be successful. 

I restarted my entire code twice near the end which caused a lot of stress and anxiety, but ultimately I finished with by far the cleanest code I had attempted, which was satisfying to say the least. I learned a great deal from this project, most notably how I should be more diligent and proactive and to reach out to my classmates more. People are always more generous than you would expect.
