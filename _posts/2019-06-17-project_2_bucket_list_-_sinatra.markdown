It didn't take me too long to think of the idea for a bucket list, after a brief meeting with my instructor. And as soon as I got the idea, I quickly got the ball rolling on the process of building it. Planning out my steps made the process much easier than how the first project of the course went. Sinatra was extremely difficult to grasp at first - keeping track of all the routing, remembering the underlying code that Sinatra performs without me explicitly coding, etc. 

I felt more confident of my knowledge leading up to this project, even though I got about 4 days behind on starting. So far, building projects is a lot more enjoyable than enduring the brutal full-time course workload. I had fun thinking of the way I wanted to structure my code, and figuring out the bugs I kept getting along the way was very satisfying. I hope to gain more confidence as I proceed through the Flatiron program. It's been an incredibly difficult road so far, but I'm proud and grateful to have made it this far, especially with no prior coding experience.
