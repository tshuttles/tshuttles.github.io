This is actually my second attempt at the CLI/Scraping project. I was bumped back to the beginning of the program after I failed to successfully pass the Sinatra project. It was difficult trying to cover two months of material in just a few weeks to submit this project on time, so I eventually had to ask for a week extension. I had forgotten how to do more than I originally thought, which was an eye opening experience, of which I am glad that I had. 

For this project, I decided to make about Austin, Texas. Which is my home. I chose a website that lists the top attractions in Austin, Texas, as a sort of advertisement for people to visit. It's a great city full of history, culture, and great food and people. 

I had much more trouble than I anticipated, making this project for a second time. It was difficult remembering how to scrape effectively and accurately. I also could not figure out how to solve the problem of my second-level scrape not working properly. Despite all the issues, I still think it is slightly better than my first effort, though, thanks to a little extra knowledge that I have gained since then. 

After everything was said and done, I noticed that my problem-solving ability has improved as well, which was encouraging. I have gotten a lot better at being a self-sustainable coder and solving errors.
