This is actually my second attempt at the CLI/Scraping project. I was bumped back to the beginning of the program after I failed to successfully pass the Sinatra project. It was difficult trying to cover two months of material in just a few weeks to submit this project on time, so I eventually had to ask for a week extension. I had forgotten how to do more than I originally thought, which was an eye opening experience, of which I am glad that I had. 

This project, I decided to make about Austin, Texas. Which is my home. I chose a website that lists the top attractions in Austin, Texas, as a sort of advertisement for people to visit. It's a great town full of history, culture, and great food and people. 

I had much more trouble than I anticipated, making this project for a second time. I think it is slightly improved than my first effort, though, thanks to a little extra knowledge that I have gained since then. I have noticed that my problem-solving ability has improved as well, which was encouraging. I have gotten a lot better at a self-sustainable coder and solving errors.
