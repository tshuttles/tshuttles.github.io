For my second attempt on making the Sinatra project, I created a Grocery List website. I ran into some problems in the beginning because I was also in the process of setting up my local environment for the first time, so there definitely some kinks to work out in terms of installing it and getting used to a new environment. Other than some careless errors here and there, I did not have too much trouble creating this project. 

The Grocery List project has Users and Items. The user that signs up can add (create) grocery items to the web page's index, and you can individually select each item to either edit (update) it, like "whole milk" to "almond milk" or what have you, or delete it. There were a few cosmetic modifications I could not figure out how to implement, but the site works all the same. All in all, I feel like I have a pretty decent grasp of how Sinatra works.
