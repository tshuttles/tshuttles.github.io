For my World of Wizards project, which is a single-page application. I built the frontend with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and for my backend, I built it with a Rails API. For a long time I thought I would use the same theme as I had used before, but I decided to go a slightly different route. While in the same fantasy vein, I went for Harry Potter instead of something like World of Warcraft. In this project, I made a wizard and spell creation application. I've been such a big Harry Potter fan for as long as I can remember. It's made such an impression on my life and I love reading the books and watching the movies, so I had strong inspiration to make this into an application. 

Traversing through the Javascript section of this Flatiron course was really difficult. I had heard they reorganized a lot of the lessons and labs, but I didn't think I was going to have as much trouble as I did. I had no clue what I was doing most of the time, but somehow I made it this far. Honestly, I had to ask for help way more than I ever have before, even just for basic concepts, like syntax and things like fetch. I struggled constructing the code for my project for a long, long time. Not knowing how to structure everything, and not knowing what or how I even wanted to do it were the biggest battles. So essentially, I was lost most of the way. 

I think what I struggled with the most though was the interaction between the DOM and my Javascript code and grabbing the appropriate data/information from it. I wasn't console.logging enough, even though it's a coder's best friend. I had to keep reviewing over and over how fetch calls work and how to access that JSONified data. Displaying all of that data was also really difficult for me. 

Luckily, I didn't have too much trouble working with my Rails backend API, except with trying to figure out how to display unique spells for each wizard. Other than that, my only issues were with the frontend and retrieving all the data I needed. And although it's not the prettiest project, the styling always comes easiest to me. 

After getting through this Javascript section and the project, I was hoping I would've had an easier time grasping all the concepts, but once again, coding proves to be more difficult than I imagine it being. But that's ok, that's why I'm in school trying to learn how to do it. And making projects based around topics that I enjoy always makes things easier.
